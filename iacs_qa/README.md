# IACS Quality Assessment Shared Repository  
This open JRC Github repository contains code developed by the JRC (Qa4CAP project) in collaboration with Member States to implement IACS quality assessments. 
This space is used to discuss possible technical solutions, share tools and good practices related to the use of the code, and provide layouts for the implementation of the procedures required by the Union Level Methodology. These layouts can be customised by each Member State to meet the specific requirements of their systems.   
All Member States are invited to participate and contribute to this repository.   
  
Implementation of the algorithms: 
* [Extraction of the samples from the ranked list](sample_extraction/README.md)
* [Data validation tools](data_validation/README.md)
