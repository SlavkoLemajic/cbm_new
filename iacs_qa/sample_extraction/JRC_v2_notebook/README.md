The code included in this notebook, developed by the JRC, implements the procedure for Member States to define their samples for the IACS quality assessment. This involves extracting parcels from the ranked list provided by the Commission, following the selection rules in the Union Level Methodology 2024 (Chapters 3 and 4). Member States have discretion over the sample sizes, within the constraints of the Methodology.

The tool takes the ranked list in CSV format and returns a list of parcels assigned to buckets representing different interventions.

## Release notes

**Version 2 (Jupyter Notebook)**

---
**Latest update: June 12th**
* **Prioritize parcels covered by VHR images** - new feature, currently in its test phase. Aside from being able to only select the VHR-covered parcels in the extraction, the user can now prioritize covered parcels without completely disregarding the non-covered ones.
* Minor bug and typo fixes.
---

The solution is still in its beta testing phase. Implementation of some of the expected features and general optimization is planned for the upcoming weeks.

The following developments are planned for the near future:

* Some more flexibility regarding the output will soon be introduced. We are also working on making the output more informative.

* Easier way to select input files

* In the upcoming updates, a lot of emphasis will still be placed on speed improvements.

## Jupyter Notebook

The solution is written in Python, and made available in the form of a **Jupyter Notebook**. It is an interactive document that allows you to combine executable code, text, images, and visualizations all in one easily accessible place. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).

To open and use this notebook, you will need an environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks. Some recommended options to look into:
* Running the notebook in your web browser [(link)](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html)
